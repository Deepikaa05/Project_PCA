# Project_Component Analysis using PCA,NMF, and Dictionary_Learning

This project is based on the component analysis of a dataset of images i.e.detection of noisy images using PCA(Principle Component Analysis),NMF(Non-Negative Matrix Factorization and Dictionary Learning Techniques. Here in this project,we generated the set of characters like alphabets and then added the noise over each alphabet sample and then we apply PCA, NMF and Dictionary Learning and then compare the results obtained from these methods.After comparing, it is observed that even PCA works fine for fewer
samples data but still it is not able to bring back the original image completely but the other methods can separate the source and cause and bring back the original image.
